                If you specify the font-family
                or color properties on the
                &lt;body&gt; element, they will apply
                to most child elements. This is
                because the value of the
                font-family property is
                <b>inherited</b> by child elements. It
                saves you from having to apply
                these properties to as many
                elements (and results in simpler
                style sheets).

            </div>
           
            
            <div class="cell-2">
                You can compare this with the background color
                or border properties; they are <b>not inherited</b>
                by child elements. If these were inherited by all
                child elements then they page could look quite messy.
            </div>
           
    
            <div class="cell-1">
                You can force a lot of properties
                to inherit values from their
                parent elements by using
                inherit for the value of the
                properties. In this example, the
                &lt;div&gt; element with a class
                called page inherits the padding
                size from the CSS rule that
                applies to the &lt;body&gt; element.
